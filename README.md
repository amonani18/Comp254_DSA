## Introduction

COMP254 covered essential data structures and algorithms, with a focus on implementing and analyzing them in Java. The course included topics such as linked lists, trees, graphs, searching/sorting algorithms, and time complexity analysis.

## Project Overview

### Midterm Project
For the midterm project, we implemented an **Algorithmic Challenge in Java**, demonstrating our understanding of algorithm efficiency and complexity, including sorting and searching algorithms.

### Assignments

1. **Assignment 1:** Linked Lists and Stacks
   - Implemented data structures such as singly and doubly linked lists and stacks.
2. **Assignment 2:** Binary Trees and Graphs
   - Created binary search trees and graph traversal algorithms (BFS/DFS).
3. **Assignment 3:** Sorting Algorithms
   - Implemented different sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
